These sites are amazing if you're new to Material
Resources:
  1. https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/dialog
  2. https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/input
  3. https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/toast


Possible features:
  - Currently, when a user clicks the submit button the page is refreshed. It would be ideal if only the resource cards were rerendered.
  - The default image for resources without Open Graph data isn't great. It would be nice if there was a default image for each category
  - It might be nice if the submit button is disabled if any fields are left blank.
  - It might be useful if tags could be seperated by commas or spaces.
  - A notification if a resource has already been posted.

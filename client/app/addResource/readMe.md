General idea/goals:
  - User clicks button
  - popup a form (see resource above)
    - take in link
    - take in title
    - take in description
  - send to server/db
  - close after submit (maybe automatic feature)
  - submit confirmation (toast or notification)
  - make a query for new data and re-render


- This will require use of Open Graph
- TBD - logic flow and where to execute
